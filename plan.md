MVP Task - App that uses weather API to display info about a searched for city

Sprints

- Have a look at the API docs to see what we can work with (10 - 15 mins)
- Low fi into Mid-fi wireframe (MVP) (30 - 45 mins) (Done by 10:45)
- Each component in the diagram should have details on the below (where relevant) (30 - 45 mins) (12:00)
    - Component tree - working out what we want on the screen and functionality of the components (MVP)
        - state (if any)
        - props (if any)
        - behaviours (the different ways that the state is updated, if there is a state)
- Code (MVP) (1- 2 hours ) (15:15)
- Write up Readme (30 mins 15:45)
- Define stretch goals / retro   (etc)





### Planning and documentation

- Before coding your app, you should use the draw.io VS code extension to create a component tree diagram within this repository.
- Each component in the diagram should have details on the below (where relevant)
  - state (if any)
  - props (if any)
  - behaviours (the different ways that the state is updated, if there is a state)
- Your app should have a readme that describes its functionality and how it should be used. You can use a tool like [Readme.so](https://readme.so/editor) to help do this.
- It's worth planning out your day into mini-sprints/chunks and collectively agree on what work can be completed during each sprint. That way if you spend too long on a particular problem, you can re-evaluate things as a team and potentially steer in another direction.

### Code and functionality

- Your app should be in TypeScript! Remember to reference the [React/TypeScript cheat sheet](https://github.com/typescript-cheatsheets/react#reacttypescript-cheatsheets) and other resources (and Google) to help.
- The user should be able to input the name of a city and have weather information about that city added to the page. Use the following API to get your weather information: https://openweathermap.org/api. You'll need to sign up for the free tier to get an API key.
- Your app should have at least one other function/feature in addition to being able to check weather information about a city. Be creative!
